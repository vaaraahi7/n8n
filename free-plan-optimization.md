# n8n Free Plan Optimization Guide

## üÜì Free Plan Limitations

### Current Limits:
- **5,000 workflow executions/month**
- **2 active workflows maximum**
- **Community support only**
- **No advanced features** (error workflows, environments)

## üéØ Optimization Strategies

### 1. Workflow Prioritization

**High Priority Workflows (Enable First):**
1. **Invoice & Communication** - Critical for customer experience
2. **Sales Automation** - Essential for order processing

**Medium Priority (Enable when needed):**
3. **Marketing Automation** - Important for growth
4. **Social Media Automation** - Good for engagement

**Low Priority (Manual for now):**
5. **SEO Automation** - Can be done manually initially

### 2. Execution Optimization

#### Reduce Execution Frequency:
```yaml
# Instead of every hour (720 executions/month)
"0 * * * *"

# Use 3 times daily (90 executions/month)
"0 8,14,20 * * *"

# Or daily only (30 executions/month)
"0 9 * * *"
```

#### Batch Processing:
- Combine multiple operations in single workflow
- Use arrays to process multiple items at once
- Implement conditional logic to skip unnecessary executions

#### Smart Triggers:
- Use webhooks instead of polling where possible
- Implement webhook-based triggers for real-time events
- Reduce cron-based schedules

### 3. Workflow Consolidation

#### Combined Essential Workflow:
Create one "Essential Ecommerce" workflow that handles:
- Order processing
- Invoice generation
- Customer communication
- Basic inventory alerts

#### Webhook Strategy:
```javascript
// Single webhook endpoint for multiple events
if (event_type === 'order_created') {
  // Process order + send confirmation
} else if (event_type === 'order_shipped') {
  // Send shipping notification
} else if (event_type === 'order_delivered') {
  // Send delivery confirmation + review request
}
```

## üìä Execution Budget Planning

### Monthly Allocation (5,000 executions):

| Customer Communication | Per status change | 300 | Critical |
| Daily Sales Reports | Daily | 30 | High |
| Marketing Emails | Weekly | 4 | Medium |
